# vimrc
This is my personal .vimrc file. It customizes very many things and implies that one has a bunch of plugins installed.

I put it here so I don't lose it and in case somebody finds it useful.
There is a more-or-less complete list of features in the comments at the top of the file. Presuming you have all the necessary plugins installed (the vimrc presumes you use pathogen) you should be fine with just dropping it into your home folder. It will tell you how to install ctags the first time you use it.
